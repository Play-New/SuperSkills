# /strategy-init

Define the project's strategic context and priorities.

## Steps

1. Read CLAUDE.md for existing context
2. If no strategic context, ask:
   - What problem does this solve?
   - Who is it for?
   - What is the desired outcome?
   - What data sources are available?
   - What are the delivery channels?
3. Write strategic context to CLAUDE.md
4. Ask the user to prioritize what to build first
5. Record the first strategic decision
