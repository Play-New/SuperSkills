# Strategic Alignment

Proactive alignment checks and opportunity scanning.

## When This Activates

Automatically after significant code changes or when discussing project direction.

## What This Does

1. **Alignment check** — verify changes support project goals from CLAUDE.md
2. **Opportunity scan** — suggest improvements the project isn't using yet

## Opportunity Categories

### Data Opportunities
- Data collected but not analyzed
- Cross-referencing between existing sources
- Public APIs that could enrich existing data

### Pattern Opportunities
- Detectable patterns not being analyzed
- Predictions the data supports
- Anomaly detection for early problem catching

### Insight Opportunities
- Results generated but not surfaced clearly
- New angles on existing data
- Context that makes insights more actionable

### Delivery Opportunities
- Channels users frequent but system doesn't reach
- Timing improvements
- Trigger conditions currently missed

## Limits

- Advisory only, does not block
- Strategy scope, not implementation details
- Opportunities are suggestions — the human decides
